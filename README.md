# NFT-Mailing-List/Application

This application allows holders of a specific NFT to sign up to an email mailing list. The ownership of the Ethereum address is authorised through SIWE and updates to the user profile are cryptographically signed before inserting into the database.

### Development

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset # Reset database
npx prisma studio # Opens a web GUI for the database
```

## Deployment

### Database

We need a database to store all the records and data on the application. As this is aimed at a self-host, you need to have a postgresql instance. You can either set this up yourself, or use our ["one-click initalise database"](https://github.com/nft-mailing-list/init-database-heroku) to host it on Heroku.

**Hosting it with one-click**

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnft-mailing-list%2Finit-database-heroku)

* Write a suitable app name, something like "nft-mailing-list-database"
* Press "Deploy App"
* Wait for the build to happen (it should take a minute or two)
* Press "View" to test it was all correct (you should see a positive message in your browser)
* Press "Manage App" to be taken to the app dashboard

ðŸŽ‰ You now have a postgresql database to host your data!

Now we need to grab the connection details for `nft-mailing-list/application`. 

* Navigate, if you're not on it already, to the app dashboard
* Click "Settings"
* Press "Reveal Config Vars"
* Copy the whole field starting with `postgres://...`

This `postgres://...` value is needed for this project, specificall the `DB_URL` environment variable.

### Application

We now need to host this application. We can do it again with one-click to use Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnft-mailing-list%2Fapplication&env=NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,DB_URL,RPC_NODE,NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS,NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE,NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY,NEXT_PUBLIC_EVM_CHAIN_ID,NEXT_PUBLIC_EVM_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS&build-command=vercel-build)

Take a look at `.env.local.example` for some defaults on the environment variables. If you're not using Vercel and the platform does not support ENV variables through a GUI, make this into a `.env` file.

* `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Go to https://generate-secret.now.sh/32 and copy the output
* `NEXTAUTH_URL` - 
* `DB_URL` - The string you copied in the database application, starting with `postgres://`
* `RPC_NODE` - The RPC node to check chain state (ie: `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/_gg7wSSi0KMBsdKnGVfHDueq6xMB9EkC`)
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TESTNETS` - Have `true` if you want to enable testnets on connection, otherwise `false`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_TITLE` - The title of the site
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - If you don't have an [alchemy key](https://www.alchemy.com/) then use the default public one `_gg7wSSi0KMBsdKnGVfHDueq6xMB9EkC`
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVM_CHAIN_ID` - The chainID that your NFT contract is on, see https://chainlist.org/ if you are unsure
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVM_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - The contract address of your NFTs
* `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ADDRESS` - Your 0x address. SIWE with this address to access the admin panel
